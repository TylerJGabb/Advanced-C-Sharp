This is an exersise for Generic classes. I have to come up with this so it might take me a while.

1) Write a generic method to find the maximum element in the range [begin, end) where begin and end are
generic types which are IComparable

2) Write a generic method to exchange the positions of two different elements in an array
public void Exchange<T>(T[] arr, int pos1, int pos2)

3) Write a Set class. This set can contain elements of type T. These types can be IComparable
